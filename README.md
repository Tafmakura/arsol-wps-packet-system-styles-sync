## Overview
The **Arsol WP Snippets Packet System** is a revolutionary WordPress plugin that transforms how you manage custom code snippets and enhancements. Unlike traditional snippet plugins that store code in your database, our system uses a file-based approach that's more secure, maintainable, and flexible.

### Why File-Based Snippets?
Traditional snippet plugins store your code in the WordPress database, which presents several challenges:
- Database bloat and potential performance issues
- Difficulty in version control and code review
- Limited ability to organize and structure code
- Risk of code loss during database operations
- Challenges in migrating between environments

Our file-based approach offers significant advantages:
- Better organization with separate files for different functionalities
- Easy version control and code review through Git
- Improved performance by reducing database queries
- Simple backup and migration process
- Better code organization and maintainability

### Plugin Distribution & Version Control
Our snippet packets are packaged as standard WordPress plugins, offering powerful distribution and version control capabilities:
- Distribute your snippet packets as standalone WordPress plugins
- Install and update through the WordPress plugin directory or your own repository
- Version control your snippets using Git or any other version control system
- Share your snippet packets with clients or the community
- Automatic updates through WordPress's built-in update system
- Maintain different versions of your snippets for different environments
- Track changes and roll back when needed
- Package related snippets together for easy distribution

### Code Portability & Reusability
One of the biggest advantages of our system is the ability to easily reuse code from various sources:
- Copy and paste snippets directly from ChatGPT, Stack Overflow, or other plugins
- No need to modify code to work with our system - just drop it in the appropriate folder
- Seamlessly integrate code from your favorite plugins
- Share snippets between projects with simple file copying
- Maintain your code library in your preferred IDE

### Theme Integration Made Simple
Don't want to create standalone snippet packets? No problem! Our system offers seamless theme integration:
- Create a `snippets` folder in your theme
- Drop any PHP, CSS, or JS files into the appropriate subfolders
- Snippets are automatically detected and available in the dashboard
- Enable/disable theme snippets just like plugin snippets
- Perfect for theme-specific customizations
- No need to modify your theme's functions.php

### Beyond Theme's functions.php
While many developers use their theme's `functions.php` file for custom code, this approach has limitations:
- Single file becomes unwieldy as code grows
- Code is tied to the theme, making it difficult to switch themes
- No easy way to enable/disable specific functions
- Limited organization capabilities

The Arsol WP Snippets Packet System solves these problems by allowing you to:
- Create multiple function files organized by purpose
- Include CSS and JS files alongside your PHP code
- Enable/disable individual snippets through a user-friendly interface
- Maintain code independently of your theme
- Organize code into logical packets that can be nested and managed separately
- Write and edit code in your favorite IDE with full syntax highlighting and debugging support

### Advanced Features
- **Safe Mode**: Troubleshoot issues by temporarily disabling snippets
- **Nested Packets**: Create hierarchical organization of related snippets
- **Context-Aware Loading**: Load snippets only where needed (frontend, admin, or both)
- **Version Control Ready**: Perfect for Git-based workflows
- **Performance Optimized**: Load only what you need, when you need it
- **IDE Support**: Write and edit code in your preferred development environment
- **Theme Integration**: Use snippets directly within your theme structure or as standalone packets that operate like plugins
- **Code Portability**: Easily reuse code from any source

## Installation
1. Download the plugin files.
2. Upload the `arsol-wp-snippets-packet-example` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

## Customization

### Plugin Configuration
To customize this plugin for your own use, you'll need to update the following elements:

#### 1. Folder Name
- **Current**: `arsol-wp-snippets-packet-example`
- **Action**: Rename the main plugin folder to match your desired plugin name
- **Location**: Root directory name

#### 2. Main Plugin File
- **Current**: `arsol-wp-snippets-packet-example.php`
- **Action**: Rename the main plugin file to match your folder name
- **Convention**: Should match the folder name with `.php` extension

#### 3. Plugin Header Information
Update the plugin header comment block in the main PHP file:

```php
<?php
/*
Plugin Name: Arsol WP Snippet Packet: Your Plugin Name Here
Requires Plugins: arsol-wp-snippets
Plugin URI: https://yourwebsite.com/your-plugin
Description: Your plugin description here.
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Your Name
Author URI: https://yourwebsite.com
License: GPL2
Text Domain: your-plugin-textdomain
Domain Path: /languages
*/
```

**Lines to update:**
- `Plugin Name`: Change to follow the format "Arsol WP Snippet Packet: Your Plugin Name Here" (this ensures all snippet packets appear grouped together in the plugins list)
- `Requires Plugins`: **Keep as `arsol-wp-snippets`** - this should NOT be changed as all snippet packets require the base plugin
- `Plugin URI`: Update to your plugin's homepage or repository URL
- `Description`: Write a description specific to your plugin's functionality
- `Version`: Set your initial version number
- `Author`: Replace with your name or organization
- `Author URI`: Update to your website or profile URL
- `Text Domain`: Change to a unique identifier for your plugin (used for translations)

#### 4. Additional Considerations
- Update any references to the old plugin name in code comments
- Modify CSS class prefixes if they include the plugin name
- Update function prefixes to avoid conflicts with other plugins
- Change any constants or configuration variables that reference the plugin name

## Usage
Once activated, the plugin will automatically register its files. You can find the registered scripts in the Arsol WP Snippets dashboard in the WordPress admin. To enable a snippet you must enable the checkbox and save. For debugging enable WordPress debug mode and all errors will appear in the error log with all the relevant file paths.

**Important**: The user must first place their snippets in the plugin snippets directory then add a filter function in the relevant functions file depending on the snippet type. For example, a CSS snippet must first be added to the `snippets/css/` folder and its filter function added to the `includes/functions/functions-css-snippets-loader.php` file.
